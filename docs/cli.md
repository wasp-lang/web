This document describes the Wasp CLI commands, arguments, and options.

## Overview

The `wasp` command can be called from command line once [installed](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/#2-installation). 
When called without arguments, it will display its command usage and help document:

```

## Commands
### General
 - `wasp new <project-name>` creates new Wasp project. A directory with the provided project-name will be created, containing boilerplate code.
 
   ```
   $ wasp new MyFirstProject
   ```
 - `wasp version` prints current version of CLI.
 
   ```
   $ wasp version
   
   0.2.0.1
   ``` 
   
### In project
 - `wasp start` runs Wasp app in development mode. It opens a browser tab with your application running, and watches for any changes to .wasp or files in ext/ to automatically reflect in the browser. It also shows messages from web app, server and database on stdout/stderr.
 
 - `wasp clean` deletes all generated code and other cached artifacts. If using SQlite, it also deletes the SQlite database. It is the Wasp equivalent to "try shutting it down and turning back on".
  
   ```
   $ wasp clean
   
   Deleting .wasp/ directory...
   Deleted .wasp/ directory.
   ```
 
 - `wasp build` generates full web app code, ready for deployment. Use when deploying or ejecting. Generated code goes in the .wasp/build folder.
  
 - `wasp telemetry` prints [telemetry](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/telemetry) status.
   
   ```
   $ wasp telemetry 
   
   Telemetry is currently: ENABLED
   Telemetry cache directory: /home/user/.cache/wasp/telemetry/
   Last time telemetry data was sent for this project: 2021-05-27 09:21:16.79537226 UTC
   Our telemetry is anonymized and very limited in its scope: check https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/telemetry for more details.

   ```
   
#### Database 
Wasp has a set of commands for working with the database. They all start with `db` and mostly call prisma commands in the background.

 - `wasp db migrate-dev` ensures dev database corresponds to the current state of schema (entities): it generates a new migration if there are changes in the schema and it applies any pending migration to the database.
   
 - `wasp db studio` opens the GUI for inspecting your database.
