import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Most of the apps today are multi-user, and Wasp has first-class support for it, so let's see how to add it to our Todo app!

Let's define a Todo list (luckily we have an app for that now ;)) to get this done:
- [ ] Add Wasp entity `User`.
- [ ] Add `auth` Wasp declaration.
- [ ] Add `Login` and `Signup` pages
- [ ] Modify `ext/MainPage.js` so that it requires authentication.
- [ ] Add Prisma relation between `User` and `Task` entities.
- [ ] Modify our queries and actions so that they work only with the tasks belonging to the authenticated user.
- [ ] Add logout button.

## Adding entity User
First, let's define entity `User`:
```c title="main.wasp"
// ...

entity User {=psl
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    email       String  @unique
    password    String
psl=}
```

Run:
```shell-session
$ wasp db migrate-dev
```
to propagate the schema change (we added User).

## Defining `auth` declaration
Next, we want to tell Wasp that we want full-stack [authentication](language/basic-elements.md#authentication--authorization) in our app, and that it should use entity `User` for it:

```c title="main.wasp"
// ...

auth {
  // Expects entity User to have (email:String) and (password:String) fields.
  userEntity: User,
  methods: [ EmailAndPassword ], // More methods coming soon!

  onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login" // We'll see how this is used a bit later
}
```
What this means for us is that Wasp now offers us:
- Login and Signup forms located at `@wasp/auth/forms/Login` and `@wasp/auth/forms/Signup` paths, ready to be used.
- `logout()` action.
- React hook `useAuth()`.
- `context.user` as an argument within query/action.

This is a very high-level API for auth which makes it very easy to get started quickly, but is
not very flexible. If you require more control (e.g. want to execute some custom code on the server
during signup, check out [lower-level auth API](/docs/language/basic-elements#lower-level-api).

Ok, that was easy!

To recap, so far we have created:
- `User` entity.
- `auth` declaration thanks to which Wasp gives us plenty of auth functionality.

## Adding Login and Signup pages

When we declared `auth` we got login and signup forms generated for us, but now we have to use them in their pages. In our `main.wasp` we'll add the following:

```c title="main.wasp"
// ...

route "/signup" -> page Signup
page Signup {
    component: import Signup from "@ext/SignupPage"
}

route "/login" -> page Login
page Login {
    component: import Login from "@ext/LoginPage"
}
```

Great, Wasp now knows how to route these and where to find the pages. Now to the React code of the pages:

```jsx title="ext/LoginPage.js"
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

import LoginForm from '@wasp/auth/forms/Login'

const LoginPage = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <LoginForm/>
      <br/>
      <span>
        I don't have an account yet (<Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>).
      </span>
    </>
  )
}

export default LoginPage
```

Signup page is very similar to the login one:

```jsx title="ext/SignupPage.js"
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

import SignupForm from '@wasp/auth/forms/Signup'

const SignupPage = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <SignupForm/>
      <br/>
      <span>
        I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
      </span>
    </>
  )
}

export default SignupPage
```


## Updating Main page to check if user is authenticated

Now, let's see how are we going to handle the situation when user is not logged in. `Main` page is a private
page and we want users to be able to see it only if they are authenticated.
There is a specific Wasp feature that allows us to achieve this in a simple way:

```c {3} title="main.wasp"
// ...
page Main {
  authRequired: true,
  component: import Main from "@ext/MainPage.js"
}
```

With `authRequired: true` we declared that page `Main` is accessible only to the authenticated users.
If an unauthenticated user tries to access route `/` where our page `Main` is, they will be redirected to `/login` as specified with `onAuthFailedRedirectTo` property in `auth`.

Also, when `authRequired` is set to `true`, the React component of a page (specified by `component` property within `page`) will be provided `user` object as a prop. It can be accessed like this:

```jsx {1} title="ext/MainPage.js"
const MainPage = ({ user }) => {
    // do something with user
}
```

Ok, time to try out how this works!

Now, we can again run
```shell-session
$ wasp start
```

Try going to `/` in our web app -> it will now ask you to log in, and if you follow the link, you will end up at `/login`.
Once you log in or sign up, you will be sent back to `/` and you will see the todo list.

Let's now see how things look in the database! Run:
```shell-session
$ wasp db studio
```
<img alt="Database demonstration - password hashing"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_db_hash_demonstration.gif')}
     style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
/>

We see there is a user and that its password is already hashed! Wasp took care of this for us.

However, you will notice, if you try logging in with different users and creating tasks, that all users are still sharing tasks.
That is because we did not yet update queries and actions to work only on current user's tasks, so let's do that next!

## Defining User-Task relation in entities

First, let's define User-Task (one-to-many) relation (check [prisma docs on relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations)):
```c {6,13-14} title="main.wasp"
// ...
entity User {=psl
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    email       String  @unique
    password    String
    tasks       Task[]
psl=}
// ...
entity Task {=psl
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    description String
    isDone      Boolean @default(false)
    user        User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    userId      Int?
psl=}
// ...
```

We modified entities by adding User-Task relation, so let's run
```shell-session
$ wasp db migrate-dev
```
to create a database schema migration and apply it to the database.

:::note
We made `user` and `userId` in `Task` optional (via `?`) because that allows us to keep the existing tasks, which don't have a user assigned, in the database.
This is not recommended because it allows unwanted state in the database (what is the purpose of the task not belonging to anybody?) and normally we would not make these fields optional.
Instead, we would do a data migration to take care of those tasks, even if it means just deleting them all.
However, for this tutorial, for the sake of simplicity, we will stick with this.

## Updating operations to forbid access to non-authenticated users

Next, let's update the queries and actions to forbid access to non-authenticated users and to operate only on currently logged in user's tasks:
```js {1,4,6} title="ext/queries.js"
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

export const getTasks = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(403) }
  return context.entities.Task.findMany(
    { where: { user: { id: context.user.id } } }
  )
}
```

```js {1,4,8,14,15,16} title="ext/actions.js"
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

export const createTask = async ({ description }, context) => {
  if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(403) }
  return context.entities.Task.create({
    data: {
      description,
      user: { connect: { id: context.user.id } }
    }
  })
}

export const updateTask = async ({ taskId, data }, context) => {
  if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(403) }
  return context.entities.Task.updateMany({
    where: { id: taskId, user: { id: context.user.id } },
    data: { isDone: data.isDone }
  })
}
```

:::note
Due to how Prisma works, we had to convert `update` to `updateMany` in `updateTask` action to be able to specify user id in `where`.
:::

Right, that should be it!

Run
```shell-session
$ wasp start
```
and everything should work as expected now! Each user has their own tasks only they can see and edit.

Try playing around with our app, adding a few users and some tasks. Then run:
```shell-session
$ wasp db studio
```
<img alt="Database demonstration"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_db_demonstration.gif')}
     style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
/>

You will see that each user has its own tasks, just as we specified in our code!

## Logout button

Last, but not the least, let's add logout functionality:
```jsx {2,10} title="MainPage.js"
// ...
import logout from '@wasp/auth/logout.js'
//...

const MainPage = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      // ...
      <button onClick={logout}> Logout </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is it, we have working authentication system and our app is multi-user!
